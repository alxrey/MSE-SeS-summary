Squelette de rootfs dans \verb!workspace/nano/buildroot/system/skeleton!. Il est ensuite copié dans \verb!buildroot/output/target! et les fichiers nécessaires y sont ensuite ajoutés.\\
Une fois que tous les fichiers sont ajoutés, une image \verb!rootfs.xxx! est créé (xxx est ext4, squashfs, etc...)

\subsection{Types de systèmes de fichier et leurs applications}

Pour les systèmes embarqués, il existe deux catégories de systèmes de fichiers :
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Volatiles en RAM
    \item Persitants sur des Flash (NOR et de plus en plus NAND)
\end{enumerate}

Deux technologies principales sont disponible sur les Flash :  
\begin{itemize}
    \item MTD (Memory Technology Device)
    \item MMC/SD-Card (Multi-Media-Card / Secure Digital Card)
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{MMC technologies}
MMC-eMMC-SD Card is composed by 3 elements
\begin{itemize}
    \item MMC interface: handle communication with host
    \item FTL (Flash translation layer)
    \item Storage area: array of NAND chips
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{FTL}
FTL is a small controller running a firmware. Its main purpose is to transform logical sector addressing into NAND addressing. It also handles:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bad block management
    \item Garbage collection.
    \item Wear levelling
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Caractéristiques des filesystems ext2-3-4 et commande}
“Filesystem considerations for embedded devices” is a good study about filesystems used on embedded systems.\\
This file system is very used in different Linux distribution.
\begin{itemize}
    \item EXT filesystem was created in April 1992 and is a file system for the Linux kernel
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ext2 is not a journaled file system
        \item Ext2 uses block mapping in order to reduce file fragmentation (it allocates several free blocks)
        \item After an unexpected power failure or system crash (also called an unclean system shutdown), each mounted ext2 file system on the machine must be checked for consistency with the e2fsck program
    \end{itemize}
    \item EXT2 replaced it in 1993
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It was merged in the 2.4.15 kernel on November 2001
        \item Ext3 is compatible with ext2
        \item Ext3 is a journaled file system
        \item The ext3 file system prevents loss of data integrity even when an
        unclean system shutdown occurs
    \end{itemize}
    \item EXT4 arrived as a stable version in the Linux kernel in 2008
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ext4 is backward compatible with ext3 and ext2, making it possible to mount ext3 and ext2 as ext4
        \item Ext4 is included in the kernel 2.6.28
        \item Ext4 supports Large file system:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Volume max: $2^60$ bytes
            \item File max: $2^40$ bytes
        \end{itemize}
        \item Ext4 uses extents (as opposed to the traditional block mapping scheme used by ext2 and ext3), which improves performance when using large files and reduces metadata overhead for large files
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Ext4 commands}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=console,label={},caption={}]
    # Create a partition (rootfs), start 64MB, length 256MB
    sudo parted /dev/sdb mkpart primary ext4 131072s 655359s
    # Format the partition with the volume label = rootfs
    sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1 -L rootfs
    # Modify (on the fly) the ext4 configuration
    sudo tune2fs <options> /dev/sdb1
    # check the ext4 configuration
    mount
    sudo tune2fs -l /dev/sdb1
    sudo dumpe2fs /dev/sdb1
    # mount an ext4 file system
    mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 /mnt/test // with default options
    mount -t ext4 -o defaults,noatime,discard,nodiratime,data=writeback,acl,user_xattr
    /dev/sdb1 /mnt/test
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Ext4 mount options and MMC/SD-Card}
\begin{itemize}
    \item filesystem options can be activated with the mount command (or to the /etc/fstab file)
    \item These options can be modified with tune2fs command
    \item Journaling: the journaling guarantees the data consistency, but it reduces the file system performances
    \item MMC/SD-Card constraints: In order to improve the longevity of MMC/SDCard, it is necessary to reduce the unnecessary writes
    \item Mount options to reduce the unnecessary writes (man mount) :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item noatime: Do not update inode access times on this filesystem (e.g., for faster access on the news spool to speed up news servers)
        \item nodiratime: Do not update directory inode access times on this filesystem
        \item relatime: this option can replace the noatime and nodiratime if an application needs the access time information (like mutt)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Mount options for the journaling (man ext4):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data=journal: All data is committed into the journal prior to being written into the main filesystem (It is the safest option in terms of data integrity and reliability, though maybe not so much for performance
    \item Data=ordered: This is the default mode. All data is forced directly out to the main file system before the metadata being committed to the journal
    \item Data=writeback: Data ordering is not preserved - data may be written into the main filesystem after its metadata has been committed to the journal. It guarantees internal filesystem integrity, however it can allow old data to appear in files after a crash and journal recovery.
    \item Discard: Use discard requests to inform the storage that a given range of blocks is no longer in use. A MMC/SD-Card can use this information to free up space internally, using the free blocks for wear-levelling.
    \item acl: Support POSIX Access Control Lists
    \item user\_xattr: Support "user." extended attributes
    \item default : rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, and async
    \begin{itemize}
        \item rw : read-write
        \item suid : Allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits
        \item dev : Interpret character or block special devices on the filesystem
        \item exec : Permit execution of binaries
        \item auto : Can be mounted with the -a option (mount –a)
        \item nouser : Forbid an ordinary (i.e., non-root) user to mount the filesystem
        \item async : All I/O to the filesystem should be done asynchronously
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{/etc/fstab file}
File \textbf{/etc/fstab} contains descriptive information about the filesystems the system can mount
\begin{itemize}
    \item file system : block special device or remote filesystem to be mounted
    \item mount pt : mount point for the filesystem
    \item type : the filesystem type
    \item options : mount options associated with the filesystem
    \item dump : used by the dump (backup filesystem) command to determine whichfilesystems need to be dumped (0 = no backup)
    \item pass : used by the fsck (8) program to determine the order in which filesystem checks are done at reboot time. The root filesystem should be specified with 1, and other filesystems should have a 2. if <pass> is not present or equal 0 -> fsck willassume that the filesystem is not checked.
    \item Field options: It contains at least the type of mount plus any additional options appropriate to the filesystem type.
\end{itemize}
Common for all types of file system are the options (man mount) :
\begin{itemize}
    \item auto : Can be mounted with the -a option (mount -a)
    \item defaults : Use default options: rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, and async
    \item nosuid : Do not allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits to take effect
    \item noexec : Do not allow direct execution of any binaries on the mounted file system
    \item nodev : Do not interpret character or block special devices on the file system
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Autre type de FS}

\subsubsection{BTRFS (B-Tree filesystem)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item BTRFS is a “new” file system compared to EXT. It is originally created by Oracle in 2007, it is a B-Tree filesystem
    \item It is considered stable since 2014
    \item Since 2015 BTRFS is the default rootfs for openSUSE
    \item BTRFS inspires from both Reiserfs and ZFS
    \item Theodore Ts’o (ext3-ext4 main developer) said that BTRFS has a better direction than ext4 because "it offers improvements in scalability, reliability, and ease of management"
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{F2FS (Flash-Friendly File System)}
It is a log filesystem. It can be tuned using many parameters to allow best handling on different supports.\\
F2FS features :
\begin{itemize}
    \item Atomic operations
    \item Defragmentation
    \item TRIM support (reporting free blocks for reuse)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{NILFS2 (New Implementation of a Log-structured File System)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation
    \item NILFS2 Merged in Linux kernel version 2.6.30
    \item NILFS2 is a log filesystem
    \item CoW for checkpoints and snapshots
    \item Userspace garbage collector
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{XFS (Flash-Friendly File System)}
XFS was developed by SGI in 1993.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Added to Linux kernel in 2001
    \item On disk format updated in Linux version 3.10
    \item XFS is a journaling filesystem
    \item Supports huge filesystems
    \item Designed for scalability
    \item Does not seem to be handling power loss (standby state) well
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{ZFS (Zettabyte ($10^21$)File System)}
ZFS is a combined file system and logical volume manager designed by Sun Microsystems.
\begin{itemize}
    \item ZFS is a B-Tree file system
    \item Provides strong data integrity
    \item Supports huge filesystems
    \item Not intended for embedded systems (requires RAM)
    \item License not compatible with Linux
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
Performances:
\begin{itemize}
    \item EXT4 is currently the best solution for embedded systems using MMC
    \item F2FS and NILFS2 show impressive write performances
\end{itemize}
Features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item BTRFS is a next generation filesystem
    \item NILFS2 provides simpler but similar features
\end{itemize}
Scalability:
\begin{itemize}
    \item EXT4 clearly doesn’t scale as well as BTRFS and F2FS
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Architecture des FS}

\subsubsection{Journalized filesystem}
A journalized filesystem keeps track of every modification in a journal in a dedicated area
\begin{itemize}
    \item EXT3, EXT4, XFS, Reiser4
    \item Journal allows to restore a corrupted filesystem
    \item Modifications are first recorded in the journal
    \item Modifications are applied on the disk
    \item If a corruption occurs: The File System will either keep or drop the
    modifications
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Journal is consistent : we replay the journal at mount time
        \item Journal is not consistent : we drop the modifications
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{B-Tree filesystem}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ZFS, BTRFS, NILFS2
    \item B+ tree is a data structure that generalized binary trees
    \item CoW (Copy on Write) is used to ensure no corruption occurs at runtime :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The original storage is never modified. When a write request is made, data is written to a new storage area
        \item Original storage is preserved until modifications are committed
        \item If an interruption occurs during writing the new storage area, original storage can be used
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{Figures/fileSystem/b-tree.png}
    \caption{B-tree type FS execution}
    \label{fig:b-tree}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Log filesystem}
Log-structured filesystems use the storage medium as circular buffer and new
blocks are always written to the end.
\begin{itemize}
    \item F2FS, NILFS2, JFFS2, UBIFS
    \item Log-structured filesystems are often used for flash media since they will naturally perform wear-levelling
    \item The log-structured approach is a specific form of copy-on-write behavior
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{Figures/fileSystem/log_fs.png}
    \label{fig:log_fs}
\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initial state
    \item Block 1-3 are updated, old blocks 1-3 are not used
    \item Garbage copies block2 and 4, and frees old block1-2-3-4
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Caractéristiques de Squashfs et commande}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Squashfs is a compressed read-only filesystem for Linux
    \item Squashfs versions
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Squashfs 2.0 and squashfs 2.1: 2004, kernel 2.2
        \item Squashfs 3.0: 2006, kernel 2.6.12
        \item Squashfs 4.2: 2011, kernel 2.6.29
    \end{itemize}
    \item It uses gzip, lzma, lzo, lz4 and xz compression to compress files, inodes and directories
    \item SquashFS 4.0 supports 64 bit filesystems and files (larger than 4GB), full uid/gid information, hard links and timestamps
    \item Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival use, and in embedded systems with small processors where low overhead is needed
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{Figures/fileSystem/squashSystPerf.png}
    \label{fig:squashSystPerf}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Create and use squashed file systems}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create the squashed file system dir.sqsh for the regular directory /data/config/ :
    \begin{lstlisting}[style=console,label={},caption={}]
        bash# mksquashfs /data/config/ /data/dir.sqsh
    \end{lstlisting}
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{Figures/fileSystem/msquashfsCom.png}
        \label{fig:msquashfsCom}
    \end{figure}
    \item The mount command is used with a loopback device in order to read the squashed file system dir.sqsh
    \begin{lstlisting}[style=console,label={},caption={}]
        bash# mkdir /mnt/dir
        bash# mount -o loop -t squashfs /data/dir.sqsh /mnt/dir
        bash# ls /mnt/dir
    \end{lstlisting}
    \item It is possible to copy the dir.sqsh to an unmounted partition (e.g. /dev/sdb2) with the dd command and next to mount the partition as squashfs file system
    \begin{lstlisting}[style=console,label={},caption={}]
        bash# umount /dev/sdb2
        bash# dd if=dir.sqsh of=/dev/sdb2
        bash# mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt/dir -t squashfs
        bash# ls /mnt/dir
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Caractéristiques de tmpfs et commandes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tmpfs is a file system which keeps all files in virtual memory
    \item Everything in tmpfs is temporary in the sense that no files will be created on your hard drive. If you unmount a tmpfs instance, everything stored therein is lost.
    \item tmpfs puts everything into the kernel internal caches and grows and shrinks to accommodate the files it contains and is able to swap unneeded pages out to swap space. It has maximum size limits which can be adjusted on the fly via 'mount -o remount ...’
    \item If you compare it to ramfs you gain swapping and limit checking. Another similar thing is the RAM disk (/dev/ram*), which simulates a fixed size hard disk in physical RAM, where you have to create an ordinary filesystem on top. Ramdisks cannot swap and you do not have the possibility to resize them
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Devtmpfs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item devtmpfs is a file system with automatically populates nodes files (/dev/…) known by the kernel.
    \item This means, it is not necessary to have udev running nor to create a static /dev layout with additional, unneeded and not present device nodes.
    \item Instead the kernel populates the appropriate information based on the known devices.
    \item The kernel executes this command : mount -n -t devtmpfs devtmpfs /dev
    \item /dev is automatically populated by the kernel with its known devices
    \begin{lstlisting}[style=console,label={},caption={}]
        # ls /dev
        autofs ptypf tty47
        btrfs-control random tty48
        bus rtc0 tty49
        console shm tty5
        cpu_dma_latency snapshot tty50
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Caractéristiques de LUKSfs et commandes}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Data in the LUKS partition is encrypted
	\item Data used in the user space is decrypted by dmcrypt
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{Figures/fileSystem/luksFct.png}
    \label{fig:luksFct}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) is the standard for Linux hard disk encryption
\item By providing a standard on-disk-format, it does not only facilitate compatibility among distributions, but also provides secure management of multiple user passwords
\item In contrast to existing solution, LUKS stores all necessary setup information in the partition header, enabling the user to transport or migrate his data seamlessly
\item LUKS - dmcrypt crypts an entire partition
\item Luks features
\begin{itemize}
\item compatibility via standardization
\item secure against attacks
\item support for multiple keys
\item effective passphrase revocation
\item free
\end{itemize}
\item cryptsetup is a utility used to configure dmcrypt
\item cryptsetup uses the /dev/random and /dev/urandom node file
\item dmcrypt (Device-mapper) crypts target and provides transparent encryption of block
devices using the kernel crypto API (kernel configuration, Cryptographic API)
\item Device-mapper is included in the Linux 2.6 and 3.x kernel that provides a generic way
to create virtual layers of block devices. It is required by LVM2 (Logical Volume Management)
\item The user can basically specify one of the symmetric ciphers, an encryption mode, a key (of any allowed size), an iv generation mode and then the user can create a new block device node file in /dev/mapper
\item All data written to this device will be encrypted and all data read from this device will be decrypted
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{Figures/fileSystem/luksCont.png}
    \label{fig:luksCont}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Create LUKS partition}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=console,label={},caption={}]
	# sudo cryptsetup --debug --pbkdf pbkdf2 luksFormat $DEVICE
	Be careful, type yes in UPPERCASE
	Or create a LUKS partition for the system with enough memory
	# sudo cryptsetup --debug luksFormat $DEVICE
	Be careful, type yes in UPPERCASE
	Dump the header information of a LUKS device
	# sudo cryptsetup luksDump $DEVICE
	Create a mapping /dev/mapper/usrfs1 and ask the passphrase
	# sudo cryptsetup --debug open --type luks $DEVICE usrfs1
	Show the node file
	# ls /dev/mapper/
	Format the LUKS partition as ext4 partition
	# sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/usrfs1
	Mount the LUKS partition to /mnt/usrfs
	# sudo mkdir /mnt/usrfs
	# sudo mount /dev/mapper/usrfs1 /mnt/usrfs
	Work with the LUKS partition
	# ls /mnt/usrfs
	# copy files to /mnt/usrfs
	Unmount the LUKS partition
	# sudo umount /dev/mapper/usrfs1
	Removes the existing mapping usrfs1 and wipes the key from kernel memory
	# sudo cryptosetup close usrfs1
	dmsetup: low level logical volume management
	# dmsetup info -C
	# dmsetup remove -f usrfs1
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Use LUKS partition}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=console,label={},caption={}]
Create a mapping /dev/mapper/usrfs1 and ask the passphrase
# sudo cryptsetup --debug open --type luks $DEVICE usrfs1
Mount the LUKS partition to /mnt/usrfs
# sudo mount /dev/mapper/usrfs1 /mnt/usrfs
Unmount the LUKS partition
# umount /dev/mapper/usrfs1
Removes the existing mapping usrfs1 and wipes the key from kernel memory
# cryptosetup close usrfs1
It is possible to manage a luks partition with:
# dmsetup info -c
# dmsetup remove -f usrfs1
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Gestion des clés de LUKS 42}
\subsubsection{LUKS - key generation}
\begin{itemize}
\item LUKS uses the TKS1 template in order to generate secure key
\item The key is derived from a passphrase
\item LUKS supports multiple keys/passphrases
\item TKS1 uses Argon2 or PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) method in order to provide a better resistance against brute force attacks based on entropy weak user passphrase.
\item TKS1 uses two level hierarchy of cryptographic keys to provide the ability to change passphrases
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The system initialization is straight forward :}
\begin{itemize}
\item A master key is generated
\item Passphrase, Salt, iterations and other values are inputs of the functions Argon2 or PBKDF2
\item A derived passphrase key is computed by Argon2 or PBKDF2
\item The master key is encrypted by the derived passphrase key.
\item The encrypted master key, the iteration rate and the salt are stored
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Caractéristiques de InitramFS et commandes}

\begin{itemize}
\item initramfs is a root filesystem that is loaded at an early stage of the boot
process.
\item It is the successor of initrd.
\item It provides early userspace commands which lets the system do things that
the kernel cannot easily do by itself during the boot process.
\item Using initramfs is optional.
\item Boot without initramfs:
\begin{itemize}
\item By default, the kernel initializes hardware using built-in drivers, mounts the specified root partition, loads the rootfs and starts the init scritps
\item Init scripts can load additional modules and starts services until it eventually allows users to log in. This is a good default behavior and sufficient for many users
\end{itemize}
\item An initramfs is generally used for advanced requirements; for users who need to perform certain tasks as early as possible, even before the rootfs is mounted.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Boot sequence, with initramfs}

\subsection{Création d'un initramFS}
On PC, NanoPi rootfs is in this directory: HOME/workspace/nano/buildroot/output/target/\\
\textbf{Principle to build an initramfs :}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Copy the right files into a directory (\$HOME/ramfs)
\item Copy these files in a cpio archive file
\item Compress this file
\item Add the uboot header
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[H]

\subsection{Init script}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=console,label={},caption={}]
#!/bin/busybox sh
# Init script in the initRamFS
mount -t proc none /proc
mount -t sysfs none /sys
mount -t ext4 /dev/mmcblk0p2 /newroot
mount -n -t devtmpfs devtmpfs /newroot/dev
exec switch_root /newroot /sbin/init
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Shared library dependency}
\begin{itemize}
\item Generally, programs are dynamically linked (other possibility: statically linked)
\item A dynamically program must have all necessary libraries
\item Example (on PC) for the /bin/ls program : \textbf{ldd ls}
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=console,label={lst:init_ramfs},caption={}]
